# OpenGA
Open Source Project for Genetic Algorithms (and other EA's) using C++14

Objectives: To develop a cross-platform open source toolkit for solving complex 'real-world' single or multiobjective optimisation problems using genetic algorithms. An understanding of Genetic Algorithms (GA's) can be found on the Internet (e.g https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm).

Why Do This: I previously developed a toolkiot for GA's, as part of my PhD thesis, however this was done using Microsoft Visual Basic (VB). Whilst the VB language served my needs at that time, I have always wanted to make my work available to others using a more 'portable' and 'cross-platform' language. Hence this project.

Project Timeline: I'll let you know more once I have a plan, as I am considering a complete re-design given the different language features available to me using C++14.

As soon as I get the toolkit structure outlined to a sufficient level to convey my design approach, I will then welcome contributions. Until then, watch this space for changes.
